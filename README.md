# ICOS Prototype Project

For this assignment, I had to make a clickable prototype of my project for my Software Specifications class. In order to do so, I used Adobe XD. The following demo of the prototype assumes that the user logging in has the highest permissions possible (in other words, they're at or above the store rank of Assistant Manager).
