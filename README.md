README for a Software Specifications project
# ICOS Prototype Project

For this assignment, I had to make a clickable prototype of my project for my Software Specifications class. In order to do so, I used Adobe XD.

The following demo of the prototype assumes that the user logging in has the highest permissions possible (in other words, they're at or above the store rank of Assistant Manager).

The sample report you see in the gif is simply a placeholder - in its place would be a real report if this were the full version of the product. I simply took a random image of a mock report from the internet for this.
